# JavaScript Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of basic JavaScript projects! These projects were created as part of my learning journey in JavaScript. Each project helped me understand and apply different JavaScript concepts, from DOM manipulation to event handling and animations.

## Projects Included

1. **Background Gradient Generator**
   - A simple tool to create and preview linear gradients by adjusting the color stops.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - A classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in the browser.

3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
   - A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you can play against the computer.

4. **Random Photo Generator**
   - A fun project that fetches and displays random photos from an API.

5. **To-Do List**
   - A basic to-do list app where you can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

6. **Heart-Trail Animation**
   - A creative animation where hearts follow your mouse cursor as you move it around the screen.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhavesh-Teli/JavaScript-Basic-Project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd your-repo-name
3. Open the index.html file in your browser for each project.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## What I Learned

- DOM Manipulation**: How to interact with and change the structure of the web page using JavaScript.
- Event Handling**: How to respond to user inputs and actions like clicks and keystrokes.
- CSS Animations**: How to create simple yet effective animations using CSS and JavaScript.
- APIs**: How to fetch data from external sources and display it dynamically on a webpage.

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced features to each project.
- Improve the user interface and user experience.
- Refactor the code to make it more efficient and modular.
